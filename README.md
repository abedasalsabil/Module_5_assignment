# Module_5_assignment
Hello, my name is Abeda Salsabil
This here is my matplotlib assignment on Pymaceuticals, Inc., a new pharmaceutical company that specializes in anti-cancer medications.
"In this study, 249 mice  were identified with SCC tumors and received treatment with a range of drug regimens."
The jupyter notebook I have presented, called Pymaceutical_analysis, is my high level analysis of this clinical study. 
The notebook can be found in the file called 'code' on the latest commit.
In this notebook I have plotted summary tables, bar graphs, pie charts, line graphs, and scatter plots, in order to make further analysis of my findings. 

I hope whoever reads this enjoys my work as much as I enjoyed making this!

I would like to thank my intructor, Madhur, for teaching me all the different methods of how to illustrate data. I would also like to thank all the LA's for answering my multiple questions throughout my process of making this notebook.

Happy coding!!!
